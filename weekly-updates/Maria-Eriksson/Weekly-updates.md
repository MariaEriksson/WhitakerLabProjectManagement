#### What brought you joy this week?

* Spending time with friends in Finland :love_letter: I haven't had an extended bit of time in Finland since... I moved. So it's been really nice having lots of catch-ups, instead of having to squeeze everyone into a single weekend.
* Lil Louie :dog::heartbeat:
* Getting into GitHub has been so FUN. Didn't think I'd have as much fun as I'm having :dancer:
* I looooved LC's talk at lab meeting :raised_hands:

#### What did you achieve?

* I set up a GitHub repo for a paper I'd like to publish :tada: How exciting! I've gotten most of my scripts moved over, and am loving the structure and organisation it is bringing to my work habits :surfer:
* Finished cleaning my seizure/AED outcome data wohooo :muscle:
* Reached out to HJ (Engage@Turing student) and had a lovely chat :coffee: I pitched having co-working sessions with Engage@Turing students - let's see if the other reps like the idea... :eyes:
* Had a great mentoring session with IS - super excited to incorporate her feedback into my script! :pray: 
* Attended a bunch of talks & seminars: HDRUK Turing Health Data Science Seminar, Developmental Neuroscience Seminar, Turing Student Seminar, BRC Symposium, ICH Neurosciences Seminar.
* Had some lovely co-working sessions with my data buds :sparkling_heart:
* I was invited to collaborate on a study with a new PhD student/surgeon trainee, and provided feedback on the project proposal.

#### What did you struggle with?

* Had so MUCH to organise before my flight back to London. And felt quite unwell as a result. Glad that's done. Phew.
* I'm stuck in my cross-validation script. But I'm thinking I'll come back to it after I wrap things up with the paper/new repo.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I need to update *all* of my scripts in the new repo, so that they incorporate the rest of the outcome data.
* Working on the manuscript for the new repo - I would really like to get a first draft of the abstract, front page, introduction and methods done this week.
* Looking forward to the Engage@Turing student showcase :sparkles:
* Also looking forward to my first mentoring sessions with EK and IKG :yellow_heart:
* Someone reached out after the talk I gave at Young Epilepsy back in January, and wants to chat about data standards in epilepsy (big) data, so that pretty cool.

#### Any other topics

* Am loving using emojis in these notes :satisfied:
