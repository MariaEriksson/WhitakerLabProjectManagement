## Date: 2021-03-24

### Who did you help this week?

- MS and KW run a Turing Way/Binder workshop for Engage@Turing students
- Other members of my Carpentries instructor training cohort with questions and suggestions

### Who helped you this week?

- MS for setting up the workshop so well that I could just turn up and do my thing
- AN and SC for running such a wonderful training

### What did you achieve?

- Completed the Carpentries Instructor Training course.
  Only the checkout procedure to go!
- Delivered Zero-to-Binder and received a lot of positive feedback

### What did you struggle with?

- I probably overcommitted myself.
  Spent a lot of time in meetings/trainings this week rather than working.
  It'll pay off in the long run, but also probably burned myself out a touch.
- I wish some internal training could be as engaging as the external training I received

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Finishing my slides for my talk at Lund and giving a great talk/tutorial
- Scoping a person to look after the Turing Binder Federation cluster with me
- Should probably focus on some LwM stuff too

### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- All good I think!

### Who did you help this week?

- MS think through agenda for HDRUK Binder workshop next week
- CM question on Kubernetes.
  I gave some "this is how I would try and narrow the problem down" advice.
- My OLS-3 mentees.
  I think they will benefit from GA's advice on communicating with dev teams so coordinated a meeting.
- A whole bunch of people (30?) at the SSI Research Software Camp Binder workshop who wanted to know about reproducibility and building binders!

### Who helped you this week?

- KW by being at the other of end of Slack and just knowing how hard it can be
- AM with some fun discussions on what start-ups are like
- My OLS-3 mentor with advice and sympathy on culture in institutions
- EM, SB and MV with running the SSI Binder workshop

### What did you achieve?

- Successful Binder workshop at the SSI Research Software Camp
- Gave a talk on Binder at a Remote ReproHack
- Moved Hub23 onto the same cluster as the Turing Binder Federation deployement, halving financial and maintenance costs
- Explicitly wrote down the minimum tasks I do to support the Turing Binder Federation cluster for transparency and sustainability

### What did you struggle with?

- Deeply embedded institutional biases
- Finding the motivation to work on a task that will likely not be appreciated even though you can see the benefit

### What would you like to work on next week?

- Software Carpentry Instructor training
- Help out with the HDRUK Binder workshop
- Prepare for another Turing Way/Binder demo for Lund University
- Scoping out who could fit the Turing Cluster Admin role if not me

### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- Continued acknowledgement and recognition that the hard things are hard

### Any other topics

My meeting with Aida today was mostly expectation setting regarding what my role might look like in the future, some therapy around institution and contrasting this with start-up culture.
