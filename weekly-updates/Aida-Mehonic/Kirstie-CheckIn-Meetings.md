# Check in meetings with Kirstie

* [Date: 25 March 2021](#date-25-march-2021)

### Date: 25 March 2021

#### Who did you help this week?

* SG, GA (mentoring chats)
  * KW: I'm so glad - thank you!
* Had a chat with EM about her handover
  * KW: So saddddd :sob: but super helpful!  

#### Who helped you this week?

* IKG (mentoring chat)
  * KW: I'm so glad you're learning about the EAG with IKG
* MS (helped me with github, and gave me feedback on OLS tasks) 
  * KW: Great stuff - thank you so much for engaging with all these skills

#### What did you achieve?

* Sent an email to JR regarding first draft of the RAM workplan for E&S theme.
  * KW: Brilliant - feel free to ping SH if JR doesn't loop him in (I think he will though)
* I think I am getting better at Github (I created a RAM repo on The Alan Turing Institute github account and started adding stuff there that I hope will scale to other RAMs and ASG researchers). 
  * KW: LOVE THIS üôå
* I am mirroring the Github repo on Turing Sharepoint for now, but that's for housekeeping for now. It might not continue for everything.
  * KW: Makes sense!
* Had the first meeting with JW to set up our little Impact reading group, and made the first steps in reaching out to people. 
  * KW: We didn't talk about this in the meeting BUT this sounds great although I'm not convinced lots of people will come along... you might have to think carefully about who you _need_ to be there and then invite them. I'd also really encourage you to post questions that come up in the #tps channel on slack - you might get good thoughts from people there if they can't make the session.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I will attend the Shocks and Resilience CTP meeting today, but I am slightly struggling to see if I am adding any value for now. I will be in a listen and wait mode.
  * KW: Thank you for coming. The onboarding work is going to be _super_ valuable. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Make a plan for the Impact reading group 
* Reach out to AD regarding the RAM workplan for his CTP
* Chat with new joiner CF (and NG if need be) to figure out how best to work with Partnerships on ASG
* Attend the management meeting for the E&S CTP and refine the RAM workplan 
* Attend CW21 
* Do more OLS training... 
* Maybe help KW with the Trinity Challenge grant prep, if that's still going ahead 
* I want to engage more deeply with the reproducibility and interoperability resources in The Turing Way- for my education, and to enable my communication with ASG, and to help plan what we need in the future.

KW: LOVE all of these!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Is there anything I could do better/more in connecting with JR and other Theme Leads for now? 
  *  I think the next step would be to start building trust with the PIs.
  *  To prepare training for postdocs. 
    * KW: I think this is a high priority area - thinking of it as a landscape mapping exercise - who are these folks? What have they done? What do they care about? Where are the opportunities?
    * And lets invite them to _The Turing Way_.
  *  To reach out to stakeholders.
* Refining the JDs for TPS Fellows and RAMs 
  * KW: YES - I think I'll make progress on that next week ‚úîÔ∏è

#### Any other topics

There always are other topics and I'm sure they will come up as we chat. üò∏

KW: Thank you for your input on TPS strategy! Excited to work with you üöÄ
