* Nice template - well done!!
* My highlights: 
  * I went to CW21 which was really valuable for me as a newbie to this community. It was an unconference which was fun and different. Will talk about it more during Lab meeting tomorrow.
  * We are onboarding newly arrived postdocs on ASG. It's been challenging to mainly communicate and be clear on the division of resposbilities with other people involved in onboarding --- but I think we have a good plan, and will do much better next time.
  * I got to attend Programme and Project meetings for AI for Science and I am so excited about working with them - lovely projects and lovely people.
    * IKG: This is all very awesome! I look forward to hearing about how the new meetings unfold!

### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* Feeling: rested, and also a lot less 'wired' than usual. I guess it shows that I took several days to read a novel and just hang out without trying to achieve anything in particular. I guess it's good for my nervous system to occasionally shut down.
* Excited about ramping up the RAM work with project teams.
  * IKG: I feel you! Four ays are now apparently too many to take off in a row!

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's figure this one out together!
  * IKG: We figured out we had to talk about:
      (i) leading Turing Way sessions, which will totally be doable in some time! And
      (ii) liaising with very different teams but making sure not to become overworked!
