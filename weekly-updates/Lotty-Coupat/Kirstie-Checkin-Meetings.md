#### Who did you help this week?

I think Sowmya has been the person who I have helped the most this week!

#### Who helped you this week?

- Malvika - showing me the Mountain of Engagement which will really help with the AutSPACEs
- Kirstie (yourself) - with my objectives 
- Lab team - ideas on how to measure success for the community integration objective

#### What did you achieve?

- Wrote my objectives and think it was a positive meeting with Esther. 
- Good meet up with Autistica and got some good ideas for the onbaording pack. 
- Created this github file/folder :D 
- Good intro chat with James Kim along with Sowmya and Isla

#### What did you struggle with?

My Concentration last week was all over the place, so I struggled to finish tasks and get ahead. However, I have entered "time planning mode" where I block out my time and timetable my days which helps me focus on what I need to get done. I also inlude some good breaks to get some life admin done and get away from the desk for like 5 mins as well as a lunchtime run for fresh air. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Onboarding Pack
- Planning out the meet-ups to structure the breakout rooms 
- Meeting Bastian for a brainstorming session on how we can increase the Open Humans communuty engagement
- Looking into/forming the Mountain of Engagement for AutSPACEs

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

- I may need some help on those measures of success for the objectives - I know we put a few of them in the chat but I don't think I can look at the chat after the meeting? I dont think would take more than 30 mins of your time maximum.
- Perhaps in our next meeting review of the Mountain of Engagement to ensure it reflects the project

#### Any other topics

Updates from Sowmya - Weekly Chats:
- She is starting to look into how to use Github to pull out data on Issues being closed and Pull Requests being merged. 
- I have said I will send her a list of requirements of what I envision the Progress Update to look like which will include the above information. 
- We discussed the fact that she successfully downloaded the docker to run the website on Windows, next steps is to look at the issues for areas to work on. 
- She is also looking into how Open Humans and the platform interlink from a data perspective.
