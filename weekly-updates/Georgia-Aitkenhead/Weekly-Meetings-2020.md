KW: The reviewing is just going to have to be slower - which sucks but is also entirely driven by a global pandemic so anyone suggesting that you (we) maintain the same levels of productivity is completely wrong.
Very happy to think through processes - try to brainstorm them with folks before you get them to me so the questions are as targetted as possible - but please don't avoid sending me things - I'm on slack all day long and very reachable - I just need qs to come in bite-ish sized chunks :sparkles:

You're doing an amazing job - thank you so so much!
