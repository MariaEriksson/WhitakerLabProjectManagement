#### Who did you help this week?

SB, GA (mentoring chats) 
Had a chat with EM about her handover 

#### Who helped you this week?

IGK (mentoring chat)
MS (helped me with github, and gave me feedback on OLS tasks) 

#### What did you achieve?

* Sent an email to JR regarding first draft of the RAM workplan for E&S theme. 
* I think I am getting better at Github (I created a RAM repo on The Alan Turing Institute github account and started adding stuff there that I hope will scale to other RAMs and ASG researchers). 
* I am mirroring the Github repo on Turing Sharepoint for now, but that's for housekeeping for now. It might not continue for everything. 
* Had the first meeting with JW to set up our little Impact reading group, and made the first steps in reaching out to people. 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I will attend the Shocks and Resilience CTP meeting today, but I am slightly struggling to see if I am adding any value for now. I will be in a listen and wait mode. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Make a plan for the Impact reading group 
* Reach out to AD regarding the RAM workplan for his CTP
* Chat with new joiner CF (and NG if need be) to figure out how best to work with Partnerships on ASG
* Attend the management meeting for the E&S CTP and refine the RAM workplan 
* Attend CW1 
* Do more OLS training... 
* Maybe help KW with the Trinity Challenge grant prep, if that's still going ahead 
* I want to engage more deeply with the reproducibility and interoperability resources in The Turing Way- for my education, and to enable my communication with ASG, and to help plan what we need in the future.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Is there anything I could do better/more in connecting with JR and other Theme Leads for now? 
    *  I think the next step would be to start building trust with the PIs.
    *  To prepare training for postdocs. 
    *  To reach out to stakeholders. 
* Refining the JDs for TPS Fellows and RAMs 

#### Any other topics

There always are other topics and I'm sure they will come up as we chat. ðŸ˜¸
