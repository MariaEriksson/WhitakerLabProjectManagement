  * KW: Really great!

#### What did you achieve?

* Spoke with GA and got that abstract submitted in under a week!
  * KW: Fun times!
* Chats with stakeholders at Turing

#### What did you struggle with?

* Meh, university. I can only hope this term's course is interesting enough, otherwise I'll just be playing the waiting game.
  * KW: Strength and solidarity :muscle:

* EAG meeting this week!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I have put together some [very simple guidelines](https://hackmd.io/DneAaMlYSnaPlsHqzskwDQ) for filling out the form as it currently is, for the purpose of *The Turing Way*.
  * Could you take a look or help me find people who could review?
  * KW: Looks REALLY GOOD!
    * Suggestions for reviewers: JC, MBr, GB, JM  - key prompt is "is this too vague?"

#### Any other topics

* Ethics Committees workshop -- I would like to get more involved...
  * KW: Super supportive of this!
    * **Who are the audience, and what do they need to read to want to come to the event?**
    * Can you have a brainstorm with AM, AB, and (maybe?) the Turing events team to see where your _gaps_ in answering this question currently are.
      Once you know the gaps you can feed those back (google doc) to the organising team.

* Finalise and record ethics workshop video for the PMU
  
#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Can we pick up the ethics-at-the-Turing paper again?

### Date: 29 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped a colleague by saying to just take an afternoon off after they'd had very difficult meetings throughout the day!
  * KW: I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

#### Who helped you this week?

* YH and LC were great to hang out with on Friday, and that was really helpful!
  * KW: Such great people :sparkling_heart:

#### What did you achieve?

* Yet another awesome meeting with MB!
  * KW: Oh this is such a joy :star2:

#### What did you struggle with?

* I've been a bit distracted with class starting just around the corner (Monday 28th being the first day).
  * Oh, and this is fun: I've been put in a Saturday slot for dissertation seminars!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I need to check the new ethics form for references to legal aspects covered by the DPAP (I think I took them out already, but will have a look) 
  * KW: Great.
* The email from RE has reignited the need for ethical guidance. I want to suggest a compilation of resources. Some universities do this: a page with links to frameworks that researchers can work with. Of course [DL's report](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf) is the best for AI in public policy, but we've also learned of an excellent [framework BV has used for researchers working on hate speech](https://www.thorn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/EmployeeResilienceGuidebookFinal7-13-1.pdf). And there are so many more. Oxford have a page similar to [this idea](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics/resources/guidance#collapse394976). We can then make it mandatory for applicants to share what framework they will follow and how.
  * KW: Strong yes on this front, Emma will be a good ally in this work.
  
#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I would really appreciate it if you finalise the ethics form with regard to the data safe haven questions -- I tried to comment on each question with where they are referenced in other sections
  * KW: Please put a 2 hour slot in my calendar for me to work on this (with 30 mins of you turning up at the end as my accountability check!)

#### Any other topics

* Not yet! I am meeting with my dissertation supervisor on Wednesday at 4 and will hopefully have the beginnings of a plan set out by the end of the week!
  * KW: Super exciting!
 * KW: Can you have a think about a submission to https://nbiair.com/#CFP - ideally including CH and VF if they're interested.

### Date: 22 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped MS by giving the Turing Way newsletter a proof read! SB helped too!
  * KW: Thank you! :pray:

#### Who helped you this week?

* LC and I worked on some OLS-2 homework - I feel like we helped each other (SB made it last Friday and we all worked together then).
  * KW: Double wonderful!

#### What did you achieve?

* Another EAG form through the finish line!
  * There was a personal information sheet missing and which our reviewer wanted to see before approving.
    The PI was really open to EAG's views.
* I've got the EAG document to a place where I think it can be shared for further comments from others.

#### What did you struggle with?

* My birthday coming up always gets me a bit feisty, haha

  * I've briefly checked a few.
  * Oxford have something similar to what we thought we could develop.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* I know presentations are a big thing in this world, but what else might work?
  * Videos?
  * I'm thinking videos again...
  * KW: Love these ideas - have a chat with Georgia too and brainstorm what works. I bet Yo might have some good ideas too!

#### Any other topics

* The OLS programme is really exciting with LC and SB!

---

### Date: 08 September 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* I helped with 4 (or 5?) different ethics applications, including one from all the way back in January!
 * KW: ROCK STAR! Great stuff!

#### Who helped you this week?

* MN and I had a chat and she helped by giving me a lot of names of different people around the institute to speak with about embedding ethics in our research culture.
  * KW: Ah, very very cool :star2:

#### What did you achieve?

* I got both DSG ethics form across the finish line (just in time!)
  * KW: So important - thank you!
* I don't know if this is an achievement exactly, but learning about Governance's Data Protection Assessment Plan was a nice surprise!
  * KW: :muscle::muscle::muscle:

#### What did you struggle with?

* To discuss in the meeting

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Having spoken with JC on 03-Sep, I want to finish off the first draft of the paper presenting the EAG for your talk.
  * KW: It's looking great - excited for the next version.

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* An idea that has been shared by several EAGers is that we could have a live document with past recommendations made to researchers so PIs can turn to it when in doubt and EAG can develop a series of best practices.
  * Could such a thing live on The Turing Way, or maybe The Turing Way can link back to this more or less live document?
  * KW: Lets make the document first and use it internally for a while to see how it goes.

#### Any other topics

* FYI, Liam will hopefully be my dissertation supervisor after all!
  * KW: Super exciting! I'm looking forward to learning from you!

#### Who helped you this week?

* You saved the day by making a Zoom room that worked for the DSSG training!
  * KW: Aaaaah my many talents!!

#### What did you achieve?

* The DSSG ethics training was a big thing for me!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Suddenly, we got three EAG forms over the weekend and I think the reviewers are at capacity.
  Also, there are the summer holidays, so this might be a larger struggle.
  * KW: Discussed in person - just keep asking politely 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Chatting with MF and MN on Thursday about delivering more training.
  I think I like the idea of working on that some more!
  * KW: Fab!
* I'm also giving the EAG folders and excel document a review for tidiness!
  * KW: GREAT IDEA!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Who could I work with on writing a post for the Turing blog about research ethics?
  I guess the thesis of that blog would be: ethical reflection is critical to the scientific method.
  But I'd love to bounce ideas around.

#### Any other topics

* None at the moment!

KW: Really good conversation about building engagement and cohesion at the Turing!!
Keep up the great work :space_invader: :star2:
   
### Date: 17 June 2020

#### Who did you help this week?

* Got some feedback on application form from EAG members
* Wrote Data Feminism blog post

#### What did you struggle with?

* Long story, something about a poorly worded survey question (not to do with work)
  * KW: Solidarity. Sounds like a super stressful week.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I am seeing different standards in ethics reviews -- or at least varying degrees of specificity in what is required from applicants... With my customer service and administrator hats on, I feel guidance must be made available to reviewers, so that expectations are clear... Can I work on setting this idea?
  * YES PLEASE :heart_eyes:

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* It would be great to hear back on the ethics form and the integration of the Safe Haven questions
  * KW: SOB - I'm so sorry I'm so slow. YES. I will do this.

  * KW: SO COOL!

#### What did you struggle with?

* Reviewing the ethics form seemed to be taking forever!

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Prepare agenda for EAG meeting on 10-June, start reviweing form's guidelines document (one chunk relies on having the form on Flexi-Grant first for screenshots)

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Guidance on new ethics approval form
  * KW: Thank you so much for putting so much thought into this form! Love it!

#### Any other topics

* Working times? Maybe I can do an four days?
  * KW: Decided in the meeting for you to take a little time off post exams and then to let me know what you'd like to do.

KW: YAAAAY - so helpful - everyone's the best! :heart_eyes:

#### What did you achieve?

* To be honest, I want to say I got the EAG chat going really nicely (although your news to LC probably got her excited too, which helped immensely!)
* Flexi-Grant finally does the job right! SO MANY OPTIONS TO TOGGLE.

KW: These are fantastic achievements! Great work!

#### What did you struggle with?

* A bit with understanding how the safe haven will fit with the EAG process -- I feel the integration, whatever it looks like, will be more long-term

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finalise new EAG form; maybe content for EAG video?
* KW: Start thinking about guidance? To go with the form & to be featured in the video :joy: 
* KW: Connect with safe haven folks about building either a public form separated from the data, or translating the classification questions into flexigrant

KW: Generally I think this is a good week to probably consolidate some of the information that you've been gathering over the last month. All going in a great direction though!

#### Where do you need help from Kirstie?

* Data Safe Haven! (In general terms)
  * KW: Thank you so much for demoing this!!
