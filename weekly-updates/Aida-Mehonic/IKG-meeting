### Date: 07 April 2021

### Past: What would you highlight from the past couple of weeks? Did you face any new challenges? You can take this opportunity to reflect on what we discussed in our previous session.
* Nice template - well done!!
* My highlights: 
  * I went to CW21 which was really valuable for me as a newbie to this community. It was an unconference which was fun and different. Will talk about it more during Lab meeting tomorrow.
  * We are onboarding newly arrived postdocs on ASG. It's been challenging to mainly communicate and be clear on the division of resposbilities with other people involved in onboarding --- but I think we have a good plan, and will do much better next time.
  * I got to attend Programme and Project meetings for AI for Science and I am so excited about working with them - lovely projects and lovely people. 

### Present: How are you feeling? Where do you see yourself right now?
* Feeling: rested, and also a lot less 'wired' than usual. I guess it shows that I took several days to read a novel and just hang out without trying to achieve anything in particular. I guess it's good for my nervous system to occasionally shut down.
* Excited about ramping up the RAM work with project teams. 

### Future: What will the focus for this meeting be? Hopefully the two previous questions prompt an idea  for this question. If not, we will figure it out together!
* Let's figure this one out together!
