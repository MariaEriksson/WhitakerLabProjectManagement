## Date: 14 February 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* Working on a project coordinated over GitHub is SO FUN!
  * Thank you AB & SH! 🌃
* _The Turing Way_ recommended in "An Emerging Technology Charter for London" https://www.london.gov.uk/publications/emerging-technology-charter-london 🌟
* LC's lab meeting was incredible 😻
* Not exactly a joy, but CF helped me SO MUCH in getting my objectives written down this week.

### What did you achieve

* Objectivesaaaaaah!
  * Redacted version at [objectives-2020-2021.md](objectives-2020-2021.md).
* PhD candidate interviews for HDRUK Doctoral programme.
* Talk on _The Turing Way_ "at" the University of Florida.
  * https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4537450
* All hands for project was tough but ultimately eye opening and hopefully useful.
* EnvSensors kick off meeting! 🌎🌍🌏
  * Got a GitHub repo 🌟
* Accenture Joint Steering Group meeting.
  * Actually did some prep work for this one - felt like I had more context to be able to participate!
* EAG discussion x2.
* Contract & planning discussions.
* Meeting on {reproducibility, reusability, openness} award.
* Chat w Raphtory team & industry contributors.
* 1:1 with IKG.
* First part of the AutSpaces meet up.

### What did you struggle with?

* I signed up to do some work that I really shouldn't have said yes to.
  The work doesn't benefit me in any way, I didn't enjoy it, and I didn't do a good job.
  Importantly it meant that I left behind far far too many other tasks.
  * Lesson for next time: **No is a complete sentence.**
* I find giving remote talks really uninspiring.
  The fact that I don't get to have interesting conversations with any of the ECRs really takes the shine off for me.
* Difficult conversations keep going.
  So far they're almost all in the direction that I reflected on over Christmas - needing to change my work practices from 2020 to give even a hope of some sustainability for 2021.
  But a couple are figuring out pathways back from deep hurt and pain.
  They're important but tough.
  * Lesson for next time: Maybe go a little more gentle on myself?
    I can't keep up full productivity and the emotional investment at the same time.
* I should have had a better attitude towards objectives.
  I _feel_ like we do them as we go along and that these are just bureaucracy, but they were a useful exercise.
  And one that shouldn't have been done at the last minute.
* I'm struggling to balance confidential discussions with a commitment to openness and transparency.
  I think that's going to take a bit of deep planning in the next few weeks.
* I fucked up and let someone down in a very non-graceful way.
  They were incredibly understanding though.
  * Lesson for next time: Say something earlier.

### Any other topics

Well, I think that proportion of joys to struggles fits my feelings about the week.

New week.
New start.
Here we go.

## Date: 7 February 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* AM has been doing amazing work scoping and developing the RAM role 🐏.
  * Everyone likes to be asked their opinions and listened to 🥰🥰🥰
* Maybe not exactly joy but very deep gratitude.
  KP did SO MUCH work on the response to reviewers and I am so grateful for her expertise :heart_eyes_cat:
* Meeting with Co-Is on the grant peer reviews was very affirming and lovely 😺
  * "This RSF proposal has a co-PI arrangement. This is good to see. Whilst Whittaker [sic] is relatively inexperienced as PI, they are a rising star. Holmes is vastly experienced and I would expect them to provide excellent mentoring." 🌠🌠🌠
  * "The PI seems well placed to lead the RSF. They are very experienced in areas of data management and analysis." 😊😊😊
* Brilliant quote shared by LC:
  * https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/145753-the-merest-accident-of-microgeography-had-meant-that-the-first
  * > "The merest accident of microgeography had meant that the first man to hear the voice of Om, and who gave Om his view of humans, was a shepherd and not a goatherd.
    > They have quite different ways of looking at the world, and the whole of history might have been different.
    > For sheep are stupid, and have to be driven.
    > But goats are intelligent, and need to be led."
  * Thank you to MS for agreeing to be the first lab goatherd 🐐
* Kickass 1:1 with EK - so excited for the Turing Way Communication Book! 📝

  So painful, but all over very quickly and no pain afterwards.
  Phew!
* Put myself forward for some media training.
* Had a play around with some code to find temperatures patterns from around the world.
  * Didn't finish it 😬

### What did you struggle with?

* Difficult conversations continue.
  Worth it.
  I hope.
  * Just have to assume that betting on myself, my time, my value alignment is better than "conventional wisdom" 😩 🤞 💪
* Ranting too much.
  I don't like sounding negative all the time.
  * Not nice when either to senior or more junior folks.
    I probably need more rest / down time.
* Kinda sorta said no to someone.... not in the most concrete way.
  Could have been better.

### Any other topics

I had a bunch of doc / life stuff this week, and I think I dealt with work tasks.... ok around them.
Workouts kinda dropped, but I made some good progress on my cross stitch.
Watched all of FATE (The Winx Saga) over the weekend.
Can't be that bad 🧚‍♀️

## Date: 31 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* Not joy exactly, but I spoke out against a problematic decision making framework.
  Which didn't help current situation, but may avoid the problem in the future.
* I missed it but I am so delighted that we have co-working sessions set up for the Autistica/Turing Citizen Science project!! :heart_eyes:
  * And a twitter account! 🙌 https://twitter.com/AutSpaces
* MS & AM & industry team did a fantastic job in the ASG MTR :sparkles:
* Folks in lab meeting had a really productive time brainstorming responsibilities

### What did you struggle with?

* Some difficult conversations.
* idk, it isn't clear that I got anything done last week.
  I wish I could just think of it as being away for those 4 days - which is the correct framing... but not a headspace I can get myself into.
* Made a bit of progress on computer says no, but also not feeling supported on the work I need to get done.
* These job descriptions are really hanging over me.
  * Lets set a goal to get these out from my head by the end of next week.
    They will bring me joy... if I can find a breakthrough on them.

## Date: 22 January 2021

### What did you struggle with?

* Feeling like I get freaking conflicting instructions - how can people be more involved, oh but they can't actually _be involved_. 😠🤬
* Can't find speakers for a knowledge share.
  No one wants to share their knowledge :sob:
* DOODLES AAAAAAH.
  They seem like such a good idea.
  But actually, I hate them
  * (This is this week's Gantt chart commitment. No. More.)
* Still haven't got my calendar properly sorted out for the year.
  Missing a bunch of 1:1s... ☹️
* Attended one meeting that made every neuron fire all at once.
  * I tried.
    I'm not going to take part in that conversation again.
  * Put. The battle. Down. Kirstie.

  And didn't leave the house often because it was raining so much 🌊
  Need to do better on exercise next week.

### Any other topics

Not much more to add.
Next week is going to be wild :scream_cat:

## Date: 15 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* SUBMITTED THE GRANT! 🥂
  YEAAAAAAAH! 🎊🎊🎊
  * I don't think its perfect but I do think its pretty good.
  * I particularly want to acknowledge how much effort has gone into equity and inclusion and the representation of ECRs at decision making levels.
    I am SO HOPEFUL that this works out. 🤞😬🤞
  * I'm also proud of the email that I sent to say thank you to all the folks who made it happen.
    I often _mean_ to send those messages but I don't actually get them done.
* I made some good progress on working with the lab on how we can adapt the interactions to grow with my responsibilities.
  Some of those conversations weren't the easiest but I'm proud of myself for having them.
  * Lab meeting was good I think.
    I loved the answers around the definition of service.
  * I don't think I got across my needs as well as I had hoped I did.
    But at least the follow up conversations helped me to see that I hadn't and could clarify.
* Great long conversation with AM and SB.
  Linked because I walked the gated road with them both but on different days.
  Always a delight 🌻
* The TPS newsletter is SO COOL!
* HM led a project check in all by himself and I'm super proud & psyched 👾
* Not really joy but I did say thank you to someone who has been doing really tough work on behalf of the TPS programme.
  I'm glad I made the effort to say that.
* Fast streamer accepted!! WOOOOO!! :star2: :star2: :star2:
* Introducing EK to the project team 😻
* Being asked to write a letter endorsing the importance of open source work is PRETTY COOL.
  * Same for the recommendation letter!! 💖

### What did you achieve

* Submitted the grant.
  Made me joyful.
  See above 😜
* Planning for lab interactions / mentorship
  * And in particular some pretty nice networkx code to showcase selected interactions 😆
* Onboarded EK (well... mostly) and I am SO GRATEFUL for her being here! 🙏
* Fun ethics planning - event series and link up with someone looking for advice.
* Planning for RAM 🐏 positions.
  Really useful conversations.
* Training Steering Group meeting.
  * Not sure how much I _achieved_ but I did support & endorse really great work done by others 😅
* Grant feedback & planning call(s).
* I _HOPE_ I helped make a plan for coordinating with the Carpentries.
* Had to enforce a code of conduct violation.
  That was wild.
  But I think I did a good job 💜
* Prepped for TPS Showcase next week.
* WILDLY not my achievement but ARIELLE got the videos submitted for the ASG MTR and they are FAB!
* BIDS Steering Group meeting.
  * FREAKING SENT the authorship guidelines .... FINALLY 💪
* Checked in with one of the TPS projects.
  Pretty confident I was reassuring.
  Hopefully I also sparked a few ideas! :grin:
* Gave useful feedback on a postdoc application! 🤔
* Said hi to the Engage at Turing students a few times.
  Hopefully in a useful way!
* Prep meeting for ASG MTR.
* Submitted the letter of recommendation for Pangeo work.
* Endorsed GSOC applications for Autistica & Turing Way projects 🙌
  * They were really done by others!
  * Gave a bit of feedback on OLS project ideas too.
* Prepped giving a reference for someone.
  Wildly excited!

### What did you struggle with?

* I had a couple of tough conversations that I think are going to lead to me having to make some difficult decisions.
  I really hope that they landed ok and that it was for the good of all...
  * (One motivational, one to say no)
* I felt patronised a couple of times this week.
  I'm curious to reflect on whether that's _me_ perceiving something that isn't there... or whether its real.
  Going to try to have one follow up conversation to check in.
* I really really hope that I was motivating in one of my conversations and not just rambling and - potentially - being patronising back 😬
  * Note to self, need to check in with that person to find out.
* I LOVED my no-meeting Friday but I didn't reply to my emails / tasks, nor get this update done.
  * So I need to do a tiny bit more to stay on top of those.
  * Although, having said that, I did submit a pretty huge grant this week 😆
    Maybe I can be a bit more gentle with myself.
* HAHA - I can't believe I almost forgot this.
  **I will never be the person in charge of making a gantt chart ever again.**
  * That shit was not. my. jam. 🍯

### Any other topics

It's amazing how much I do when I actually write it all down 🙀

Had a chill weekend, two lovely walks.
Loads of cross stitchin.

## Date: 8 January 2021

### What brought you joy this week?

* I had a phone conversation with JH about Phoenix plans that I got really jazzed about.
  But more importantly it was just lovely to get a bit of mentorship & allyship from a friend.
* Movement forwards with connecting Raphtory with an industry team who are using their code!!
* Really exciting meetings with co-is and collaborators on the big grant (deadline 12 Jan).
  I'm feeling very inspired! :sparkling_heart:
* Not joy exactly but a feeling of purpose - I had a conversation with someone going through a tough time, listened and gave advice.
  Most importantly, I said "I believe you" which I think meant more than anything else I could have said or done.
* Lab meeting was a beautiful moment of holding space for each other around the news of the attempted coup in the USA and sharing some of our personal challenges and needs for 2021.
  In particular I was proud that I shared what my needs were and how the members of the lab can help me.
* The snow on Friday was just glorious.
  So incredibly beautiful.
* I loved drawing a network with networkx!!
  I still got it!
  * Even made some [accidental art](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/status/1347139895161196556?s=20)
* No meeting Friday was the freaking BOMB!
* Co-working on [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/#download) with the CS&S team was wonderful.

### What did you achieve?

* Knowledge share seminar and strategic planning with HM and CH.
  * Set a few plans in motion for Project :fire::bird:
* Recruitment process for community manager support.
* Clarity on what we're trying to do for the big grant.
  Both internally and externally it seems like we're in a really powerful position.
  * Not always easy, but the work I did in the run up was very well aligned.
* Really fun brainstorming on TPS leadership plans.
* Useful (I hope!) feedback on EAG application.
* Worked out every day.

### What did you struggle with?

* I haven't set my calendar up the way I had hoped I would.
  I still need to get a LOT of 1:1 meetings in there.
* I didn't get job descriptions written.
  * I think I'm super blocked on those.
    I should probably chat with AL & get some input.

### Any other topics

Ah, I really hope I can keep this up :crossed_fingers:
